# Modified-Wellner-s-algorithm-binarization
The project works on binarizing document images which contains various noises such as stains, bleed-throughs etc.  The algorithm is based on Wellner's algorithm which focuses on neighbor pixels and predict the value of the target pixel.
The work is based on the paper "A Modified Wellnerâ€™s based Binarization on Ancient Malayalam
